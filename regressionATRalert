### setiing a chart to give an alert signal
# when price hits the lower band of the Regression Channel
# If the opening chart price is lower than the current center regression line 
# (ie., suggesting bullish)


# Like this: AddLabel(1, Concat(“Long SL =", LL), Color.Cyan);

# ATR lower indicator 
 #compares the daily ATR divided by 92 (23 hours of trading, therefore 92 15-minute increments on the 15 min chart)
 # with another line of the current ATR on the current 15 minute chart
